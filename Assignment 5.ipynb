The company today at the ISPO Munich has ventured into the smartphone arena with the launch of the Land Rover Explore Outdoor phone, an Android smartphone made in alliance with Bullit Group, the same company responsible for rugged devices from Caterpillar . The Land Rover explore as its name suggests is built to withstand the toughest conditions during outdoor activities, and for the specs it possesses, the device has been crowned with the Winner of the 2018 ISPO Award in the Outdoor Tools & Equipment category . \\nThe Land Rover Explore is made by Bullitt Group, but with a few “design cues” from Land Rover Discovery vehicle especially evident in its front grill design, the styling of the case back, and edges.   \\nLand Rover’s approach to the rugged design is quite different, it says the Land Rover Explore has been made to go everywhere a Land Rover Discovery can go too, so we are talking of a phone that can survive in extreme conditions far beyond what IP68 dust and waterproofing certified devices can take. It can come out unscratched from saltwater submersion, violent drops, extreme temperatures and rapid temperature changes. \\nAway from its design, the Land Rover explore comes with some modular capabilities that can enhance the functionality of the device but can only take a single addon (the adventure pack), for now, just maybe more will be added later. The Adventure Pack seen below when clipped to the phone provides it a powerful GPS antenna, more battery power, and augmented reality navigation via the inbuilt ViewRanger Skyline technology. Land Rover Explore 1 of 7 \\nLand Rover hasn’t revealed the internal makeup of the device, such details would probably be made available at the MWC later in Barcelona where the phone will be fully showcased. Interested buyers should be able to order the device later in April 2018 via Land Rover Explore and selected retailers at a recommended retail price of €649 or £599.

The new plan called for an estimated workforce of 175 people at the new headquarters by the end of 2017, with an office population of about 300 once fully operational at the end of 2018. \\nThen, as now, the company stressed that a vast majority of its 12,000 Peoria-area employees would remain local. And even as the headquarters transition moved ahead in 2017, Caterpillar continued to host customers from 36 countries and 39 states in Peoria, according to figures released by the company. \\nMore than 2,000 Caterpillar employees also continue to work Downtown in the administration buildings, which are being renovated from individual work station upgrades to infrastructure repairs on the roof. That work will continue into 2019. \\n\"Our employees’ workstations and other amenities will all be remodeled, as we have done in many of our global office buildings,\" said Henry Vicary, Caterpillar\\'s guest and community relations director. \"We believe these updates will enhance the work experience for thousands of our employees who work in downtown Peoria.\" \\nBeyond the immediate emotional reaction to the headquarters announcement last year that Mayor Jim Ardis described as a punch to the gut, the development created long-term practical concerns for area officials and residents. \\nAn entire city block had been emptied Downtown in preparation for Caterpillar\\'s former headquarters plans. Those workers weren\\'t coming back, and any private Downtown development ideas tied to Cat\\'s plans also were dashed. \\nAnd though not all Caterpillar employees tapped to work at the new headquarters would move from the Peoria area, a glut of homes entering the market all at once threatened to destabilize the residential real estate market in the region. \\nTo that end, Caterpillar introduced a real estate incentive program in phases over the course of the summer. All homes in the company\\'s relocation program — not just the houses of employees headed to the new headquarters — would be eligible for a reimbursement of certain costs of up to 3 percent of the final sale price. Additional incentives applied to select homes on the upper end of the market. \\nBy the end of the year, 132 homes in Caterpillar\\'s program sold, contributing to a slight overall increase in home sales for the year over 2016, according to the Peoria Area Association of Realtors (PAAR). Ninety homes eligible for the incentive remained on the market in January, with the program scheduled to continue through 2018. \\nProspective buyers expressed uncertainty at the time of the Caterpillar headquarters announcement, but the market with the company incentives demonstrated stability by the end of the year, said PAAR CEO Dallas Hancock. \\n\"The goal of the incentive program was sustainability, and the market here saw that in 2017,\" Hancock said, noting that some buyers came to the market because of the incentives but ended up buying other homes. \"After all that uncertainty, we\\'re seeing consumer confidence coming back up.\" \\nA couple of weeks before the one-year anniversary of Caterpillar\\'s headquarters announcement, the vacant adjacent block became the subject of major news, too. \\nThe company donated the entire block and millions of dollars that had been earmarked for demolition of the property to OSF HealthCare to redevelop the former Chase Bank building into a new ministry headquarters and create Downtown amenities for employees of both groups. \\nBusiness owners, developers, elected officials and representatives of laborers in the trades all lauded the development, eager to see life return to the vacant block and — once again — possibly spark new plans for the fading storefronts in the vicinity. \\n\"OSF HealthCare is excited to be returning to the roots of our sisters in Downtown Peoria when we move the headquarters for our Ministry into the former Chase building,\" said CEO Bob Sehring. \"This opportunity was made possible through collaboration with Caterpillar and the city of Peoria.\" \\nSehring added: \"It is our hope that this project sparks even more development as we contribute to a revitalized and robust Downtown Peoria, one that will attract and retain energetic leadership for years to come.\" \\nMatt Buedel can be reached at 686-3154 or mbuedel@pjstar.com.

Rell wowed at EDC 2016, spinning the off-the-beaten-path “Upside downHouse” and earns a spot here on this bill.

A year later, he was playing Insomniac’s flagship festival in Vegas, a tidbit he recently revealed on the “Wide Awake Stories” podcast. Now, he’s a main stage peer with Tiësto, Alesso, Oliver Heldens, the melodic Tritonal and others in the top quadrant of the bill. \\nThe full lineup is below. \\nBeyond Wonderland 2018 takes place Friday, March 16 and Saturday, March 17, at the NOS Events Center in San Bernadino.

Introduction A few months ago, I wrote an article titled, \"How Investors Could Easily Have Avoided Chicago Bridge & Iron\\'s Sell-Off.\" My basic thesis was that if investors would have looked back far enough in history, they would have known that Chicago Bridge & Iron ( CBI ) was a highly cyclical stock and that they could expect sell-offs of the stock up to 80% to happen on occasion. The most pointed critique of the article came from investors who were sitting on gigantic losses in their CBI stock. Several of them noted that my article didn\\'t do them a whole lot of good now, and they wondered where the article had been a year earlier, before CBI\\'s price had dropped.\\nEven though I claim no ability to predict the top of any stock, I have been trying my best in a recent series of articles to examine some of these rapidly rising cyclical stocks from a different point of view; a point of view that examines how far they might fall, rather than simply examining how far they might continue to rise. So far, I have written about Caterpillar ( CAT ), Boeing ( BA ), Cummins ( CMI ), Deere ( DE ) and a stock that I recently sold myself after a 90% gain, BorgWarner ( BWA ). Now let\\'s examine 3M ( MMM ) and see what its historical cycles might be able to tell us about its next potential down-cycle.\\nToday\\'s Price and Valuation If we take a look at the total return of 3M since the beginning of 2016 and compare it to the S&P 500 as a whole, here is the picture we get:\\nMMM Total Return Price data by YCharts Three corporate behemoths — Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase — announced on Tuesday that they would form an independent health care company for their employees in the United States.\\n\\nThe alliance was a sign of just how frustrated American businesses are with the state of the nation’s health care system and the rapidly spiraling cost of medical treatment. It also caused further turmoil in an industry reeling from attempts by new players to attack a notoriously inefficient, intractable web of doctors, hospitals, insurers and pharmaceutical companies.\\n\\nIt was unclear how extensively the three partners would overhaul their employees’ existing health coverage — whether they would simply help workers find a local doctor, steer employees to online medical advice or use their muscle to negotiate lower prices for drugs and procedures. While the alliance will apply only to their employees, these corporations are so closely watched that whatever successes they have could become models for other businesses.\\n\\nMajor employers, from Walmart to Caterpillar, have tried for years to tackle the high costs and complexity of health care, and have grown increasingly frustrated as Congress has deadlocked over the issue, leaving many of the thorniest issues to private industry. About 151 million Americans get their health insurance from an employer.\\n\\nBut Tuesday’s announcement landed like a thunderclap — sending stocks for insurers and other major health companies tumbling. Shares of health care companies like UnitedHealth Group and Anthem plunged on Tuesday, dragging down the broader stock market.\\n\\nThat weakness reflects the strength of the new entrants. The partnership brings together Amazon, the online retail giant known for disrupting major industries; Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company led by the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett; and JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States by assets.\\n\\nThey are moving into an industry where the lines between traditionally distinct areas, such as pharmacies, insurers and providers, are increasingly blurry. CVS Health’s deal last month to buy the health insurer Aetna for about $69 billion is just one example of the changes underway. Separately, Amazon’s potential entry into the pharmacy business continues to rattle major drug companies and distributors.\\n\\nThe companies said the initiative, which is in its early stages, would be “free from profit-making incentives and constraints,” but did not specify whether that meant they would create a nonprofit organization. The tax implications were also unclear because so few details were released.\\n\\nJamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said in a statement that the effort could eventually be expanded to benefit all Americans.\\n\\n“The health care system is complex, and we enter into this challenge open-eyed about the degree of difficulty,” Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, said in a statement . “Hard as it might be, reducing health care’s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort.”\\n\\nby Nike Wingfield, Katie Thomas and Reed Ableson, NY Times | Read more: \\nImage: Bryan Anselm \\n[ed. If ever an industry/system were ripe for disruption, health care is it. Now predators are stalking predators. It\\'s significant that Amazon is involved.

Ron, this is one of those bellwether stocks. Tell me what to think here.\\nRon Gross: Don\\'t worry about the tax hit. They had $16 billion in accumulated profits overseas, and under the new tax plan you\\'re going to take a hit on it, but it\\'s worth it. That\\'s fine. These are really strong earnings. Broke a four-year streak of declining sales. Global economy is very, very strong right now. Revenue up 35% for the quarter, North America being the strongest part of that due to growth in heavy machines and aftermarket parts, but China and Asia Pacific also very strong. I liked what I saw from guidance. I think, as a bellwether, it bodes well for the global economy. They added 4,800 jobs in the U.S. last year, and of course we can see that in the very low unemployment rate, with many companies following suit.\\nThe interesting part is, the stock actually didn\\'t react the way you would expect it to. In fact, it was down shortly after this announcement, after having popped. And I\\'m going to blame it on the Trump administration in this case, because they put out some very confusing messages about their thoughts about the dollar, do we want a weak dollar or a strong dollar. And I think it had investors kind of whipsawing back and forth. And then you have good old profit taking, with the stock being up 70% over the last year. So the confusion plus profit taking led to a stock that sold off.\\nHill: I was a little surprised by the reaction, too, in part because of, and you alluded to this, because of the guidance. I mean, this is a company that, when they start to ramp up guidance, they\\'re making huge machines. Those are investments that are going to pay off years down the line. So it really seemed like things were looking good for them.\\nGross: I think that sell off was a very short-term minded sell off. The stock is not cheap after being up 70% over the last year. You could buy stocks like Deere for cheaper multiples than you could with Caterpillar. But I think this is probably the beginning of stronger earnings.\\nChris Hill has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Ron Gross has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Excluding the tax rate impact, adjusted earnings were $2.16 a share. \\nThe average earnings forecast was $1.77 by eight analysts surveyed by Zacks Equity Research. Analysts typically do not include one-time gains and charges in their forecasts. \\nFor the full year, Caterpillar had $138 million in net income, compared with $4.08 billion a year ago. \\nThe company provided initial fiscal 2018 guidance of diluted earnings in a range of $7.75 to $8.75 a share, while adjusted earnings are projected in a range of $8.25 to $9.25 a share. \\nBy comparison, diluted earnings for fiscal 2017 was $1.26 and adjusted earnings were $6.88. \\nThe initial tax-rate cut results, particularly as it affected deferred tax assets, have been mixed among major corporations, in particular super-regional and national banks. \\nCaterpillar said $596 million of the $2.37 billion in tax reform impact came from a write-down of net deferred tax assets. \\nFrom re-measuring deferred tax assets, BB&T Corp. reported a gain of $43 million and Wells Fargo & Co. a $3.89 billion gain. Bank of America had a $1.9 billion expense, Citigroup a $22 billion expense and First Horizon National Corp. a $48 million expense. \\nUnited Technologies Corp. reported an overall $722 million tax expense. \\nCaterpillar also said it would take a $1.77 billion charge from a mandatory redeemed repatriating of cash held overseas. \\nThose charges were offset partially by a combined $260 million benefit related to other tax changes, some made before the tax reform was signed into law. \\n\"After four challenging years, many key markets improved in 2017, and our global team delivered strong results,” Jim Umpleby, Caterpillar’s chief executive, said in a statement. \\nEach of Caterpillar’s three main divisions had a sharp third-quarter revenue increase: 47 percent in construction industries to $5.26 billion; 22 percent for energy and transportation (which includes the Winston-Salem plant) to $4.71 billion; and 53 percent in resource industries to $2.2 billion. \\n“We remained focused on operational excellence and made early investments in profitable growth initiatives as we began to implement our new strategy,” Umpleby said. \\nThe company continues to benefit comparison-wise from a major – and painful – multiyear restructuring effort that resulted in significant workforce and plant reductions in the U.S. and globally. \\nPart of the restructuring was Caterpillar switching the use of its $426 million Winston-Salem plant from axle-manufacturing for mining trucks to its railroad business unit. The plant, when operating as an axle-manufacturing operation, had a peak workforce of 438. The company had pledged to create 510 full- and part-time employees. \\nHowever, over the past year, Caterpillar increased its global full-time employment by 3,000 to 98,400, as well as its part-time workforce by 7,300 to 18,300. \\nThe U.S. workforce is up year over year by 4,600 employees to 50,500, while the non-U.S. workforce has risen by 5,500 to 66,200. \\n“Caterpillar is beginning 2018 with strong sales momentum resulting from strong order rates, lean dealer inventories and an increasing backlog,” the company said. \\n“Additionally, there are positive economic indicators across most of the world and in many of the company\\'s end markets. \\n“Caterpillar is preparing its factories and suppliers to be ready for continued growth, while remaining focused on managing with a flexible and competitive cost structure that should enable the company to respond quickly if economic fundamentals change.” \\nRich Smith, an analyst with The Motley Fool, said Caterpillar’s remarkable stock run since January 2017 comes in part from increasingly optimistic outlooks from analysts on its global performance. \\nIn the two weeks, Caterpillar gained two new buy ratings, two earnings hike estimates and two higher share-price targets, once of which was by Berenberg of $200. That $200 target has been matched by analysts at JPMorgan and Wells Fargo Securities. \\nThe share price opened Thursday at $168.34. \\n\"Just as the mining downturn was more severe than expected, we believe the amplitude of the current upturn is underappreciated,” Berenberg said. “Caterpillar’s mining original equipment and aftermarket revenues are depressed beyond normal and are set to grow at 25 percent through 2020 to make up for five years of under-investments.\" \\nSmith said that “you just don\\'t see that kind of growth rate come around often in a $100-billion-plus market capitalization company like Caterpillar.” \\nChris Lange, an analyst with 24/7 Wall St., said Caterpillar benefited from an improved global economy in 2017. \\n“Machinery orders rose, and the company should get a further boost from the recent changes to U.S. tax laws,” Lange said. \\n“Because U.S. companies can now expense certain capital purchases and a proposal to spend big on the nation’s infrastructure is reportedly on its way from the president’s desk, Caterpillar’s outlook for 2018 remains generally bright.” \\nHowever, Lange cautioned that the company still has a legal shadow hanging over it in a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over how it accounts for overseas profits.

Yes, it also booked a big tax hit, but feel free to ignore that -- it\\'s just the company cashing in on the Republicans\\' big corporate tax repatriation giveaway, which is saving it a fortune. They talk about where the growth is, what\\'s to come, and what it all means.\\nA full transcript follows the video.\\nThis video was recorded on Jan. 26, 2018.\\nChris Hill: Fourth-quarter sales for Caterpillar rose 34%, but Caterpillar also took a tax hit to the tune of $2.4 billion. Ron, this is one of those bellwether stocks. Tell me what to think here.\\nRon Gross: Don\\'t worry about the tax hit. They had $16 billion in accumulated profits overseas, and under the new tax plan you\\'re going to take a hit on it, but it\\'s worth it. That\\'s fine. These are really strong earnings. Broke a four-year streak of declining sales. Global economy is very, very strong right now. Revenue up 35% for the quarter, North America being the strongest part of that due to growth in heavy machines and aftermarket parts, but China and Asia Pacific also very strong. I liked what I saw from guidance. I think, as a bellwether, it bodes well for the global economy. They added 4,800 jobs in the U.S. last year, and of course we can see that in the very low unemployment rate, with many companies following suit.\\nThe interesting part is, the stock actually didn\\'t react the way you would expect it to. In fact, it was down shortly after this announcement, after having popped. And I\\'m going to blame it on the Trump administration in this case, because they put out some very confusing messages about their thoughts about the dollar, do we want a weak dollar or a strong dollar. And I think it had investors kind of whipsawing back and forth. And then you have good old profit taking, with the stock being up 70% over the last year. So the confusion plus profit taking led to a stock that sold off.\\nHill: I was a little surprised by the reaction, too, in part because of, and you alluded to this, because of the guidance. I mean, this is a company that, when they start to ramp up guidance, they\\'re making huge machines. Those are investments that are going to pay off years down the line. So it really seemed like things were looking good for them.\\nGross: I think that sell off was a very short-term minded sell off. The stock is not cheap after being up 70% over the last year. You could buy stocks like Deere for cheaper multiples than you could with Caterpillar. But I think this is probably the beginning of stronger earnings.

There were potholes in the roads and a general mess everywhere. Yet it did not seem to dampen anyone’s enthusiasm to buy books. As in previous years there were buyers trailing suitcases on wheels to pack in the books they would buy. In fact a senior publisher I met during the fair said that the shift to January has been a boon for them as their sales grow better and better with every year. \\nThe World Book Fair is organised by the National Book Trust. It began in the early 1970s when it was a bi-annual affair before being made an annual feature. It began with the intention of making books accessible and popularising reading. Over the years it has slowly acquired some characteristics of a trade fair with its specific B2B meetings, a Rights Table, panel discussions, an increasing number of international visitors etc. This year the guest of honour was the European Union. The business collaborations that happen unexpectedly at the fair are incredible. Such as this of third-generation publisher Raphael Israel. An Indian Jew who met his Palestinian clients at the fair couple of years. It is now one of the happiest business relationships! \\nYet at the heart of it the book fair remains a B2C fair with visitors coming from around the country to buy books. In India there are bookshops but not enough to cater to the vast multi-lingual population. The presence of online retailers over the past few years has helped foster the reading habit among many especially in tier-2 and tier-3 towns. This was a sentiment expressed by many publishers participating in the fair. This time there were definitely larger number of customers many of whom were browsing through the shelves to discover more for themselves. While browsing online is convenient and helpful, algorithm driven searches do not necessarily help in discovering a variety of books for the readers. This is where the display cases at fairs and bookshops help tremendously. \\nThere were visitors of all ages and even people using walking sticks or in wheel chairs braving the potholes and dust swirling around. It did help greatly that the winter break of schools had been extended due to the excessive chill. So families came to spend their day at the book fair, browsing, buying and having a picnic. Surprisingly the crowds came even during the designated business hours so that by the afternoon it was impossible to walk through the crush of people. Over the weekends the crowds were incredible. Publishers of children’s and young adult literature were delighted with the response. Sales were unprecedented for many whereas others managed to break even. Comments such as this were often overheard: Child telling parent “Don’t say you will buy the book online. Buy it now!” Sales of the trade and academic publishers were brisk as well but some reported poorer sales than last year citing the poor location as the major reason for lack of visitors. The Hindi publishers were satisfied with the response with some saying that the usual growth of sales of 15-20% which is commensurate with the growth of their publishing y-o-y was evident. Interestingly enough this year there was a significant presence of self-publishers. Sadly though this year there was a very low turnout of Indian regional language publishers. Curiously enough the stalls of the few who participated such as the Bengali, Marathi and Urdu publishers, their signboards were written in Hindi! \\nThis was the first time that audio books made their presence felt. For example, the Swedish firm Storytel is partnering with publishers in Hindi, English and Marathi. An audio tower had been placed in the stall of Hindi publishers, Rajkamal Prakashan, where 60 audio books could be sampled. Apart from this there was evidence of newcomers who had put up stalls showcasing their storytelling websites/apps/storycards that had a digital audio version too. These were individual efforts. It was also rumoured that other bigger players could be expected to make an entrance into the Indian publishing ecosystem. Perhaps they will announce their presence at the next world book fair, January 2019? \\nUndoubtedly the local book market is growing as there are still many first generation buyers of books in India. Despite the vast variety of books on display it was the backlist of most publishers which was moving rapidly. Pan Macmillan India for instance had a corner dedicated to their Macmillan Classics that were very popular. Interestingly the branded authors such as Enid Blyton, Bear Grylls and J. K. Rowling had entire shelves dedicated to their works. At a time when most authors are jostling for space to be seen and heard, these generous displays by publishers for a single author were a testimony to the significance and influence they wield with readers. Obviously the long tail of backlists are good business. Repro is collaborating with Ingram to offer Print On Demand ( POD) services. These work well for those with significant backlists that need to be kept alive for customers but to avoid excessive warehousing costs and tying up cash in stock, it is best to offer POD services to customers. The demand for a backlist title of a specific publishing house is fulfilled by vendors who use the marketplaces offered by online retailers. The cost of the title purchased is higher than if it had been part of a print run but this arrangement works favourably for everyone concerned. \\nWhile browsing through the bookshelves it was not uncommon to notice readers either standing absorbed in reading or sitting peacefully crosslegged on the floor reading through the books they had shortlisted. What was remarkable was how serenely they sat despite the crowds milling around them. If there were displays on tables as at the DK India stall and the regional language stalls, people were standing and reading calmly. \\n\\nHappily a large number of younger customers thronged the fair and buying. Even though some publishers said that few people haggled for discounts the crowds at the secondhand and remaindered stalls had to be seen. There was such a melee. Books were being sold for as little as 3 for Rs 100! While publishers were not amused at the presence of these remaindered stalls doing brisk business, customers were delighted that for a small amount of money they could buy a pile of books. \\nAll said and done it was a satisfying book fair. Hats off to the National Book Trust team for running it so smoothly and efficiently every year! Wednesday, January 31, 2018 Keep Asking: Is this a need or is this a want? Since the theme of this year is SAVE! SAVE! SAVE!, I must constantly remind myself whether something I want is a real need or not. For instance, I have an old rug in the kitchen. It doesn\\'t look bad. Only I know how old it is. Besides, if I did not have that rug, do I really need one in the kitchen? Not really. So, that has been crossed from my list. Have I ever told you about that list of mine? I don\\'t think so. Whenever I feel like I must buy something, I put it on a list. Once or twice every week, I visit that list and extract my weekly grocery shopping items. So, you see it is more of a catch all list. I want a pair of nice Caterpillar boots. The boots I currently have, started to look shabby and although I think, they will survive this winter, I will need new boots next year. So, for now, I have put the boots on my list and noted the current price. When I go to my primary residence next week, I will see if there are other boots that I can wear so that I can postpone this purchase. I may have some less worn boots but for a while I could not wear them. I had some pain issues and I relied solely on New Balance Athletic shoes and the boots that I currently wear. My problems are gone and I may try to go back to wearing my old footwear to see if the problems will come back or not. If it does, there is motivation to purge right there! I was thinking of getting a new bedspread for the bed in my primary home but, since I will give up the studio in the summer, I will end up with extra bedspreads anyway. Pooof! No more a need. Just got crossed off my list. I was at IKEA yesterday. Since the weather was bad, I just wanted to stretch my legs. I really did not need anything to buy except for ziplock baggies. Meanwhile, on my need list, I had some hand towels. I was looking for the cheap white kind which can be bleached and this has been a long time need but I simply refused to pay more than a certain amount for them. I found towels that were just what I wanted and the price was very close to what I would be willing to pay. Then all of a sudden, I remembered that I had a 20 TL off gift card from a previous purchase which was about to expire. Voila! The cost of the hand towels came to a figure below what I would be willing to pay. A bit of patience sometimes goes a long way. Using a list makes your buying choices a somewhat fun exercise too. How? You get creative. For instance, sometimes, I find things to re-purpose to serve a need and cross the related item off my list. Every penny saved now is a penny that might be badly needed in retirement. I am a big proponent of the quote: \" Use it up , wear it out, make it do , or do without .” Posted by Samsung essentially informs the US government not to shoot itself in the foot \\nJan 31, 2018 | 0 | \\nIt was reported last year that Samsung was believing about establishing a new plant in the United States to manufacture appliances.

Receive News & Ratings for Caterpillar   analysts\\' ratings for Caterpillar and related companies   daily email newsletter . « Disaster Coordinator urges public to adhere to early warning signs The alliance was a sign of just how frustrated U.S. businesses are with the state of the nation’s health care system and the rapidly spiraling cost of medical treatment. \\nIt also caused further turmoil in an industry reeling from attempts by new players to attack a notoriously inefficient, intractable web of doctors, hospitals, insurers and pharmaceutical companies. \\nIt was unclear how extensively the three partners would overhaul their employees’ existing health coverage — whether they would simply help workers find a local doctor, steer employees to online medical advice or use their muscle to negotiate lower prices for drugs and procedures. While the alliance will apply only to their employees, these corporations are so closely watched that whatever successes they have could become models for other businesses. \\nMajor employers, from Walmart to Caterpillar, have tried for years to tackle the high costs and complexity of health care, and have grown increasingly frustrated as Congress has deadlocked over the issue, leaving many of the thorniest issues to private industry. About 151 million Americans get their health insurance from an employer. \\nBut Tuesday’s announcement landed like a thunderclap — sending stocks for insurers and other major health companies tumbling. Shares of health care companies like UnitedHealth Group and Anthem plunged on Tuesday, dragging down the broader stock market. \\nThat weakness reflects the strength of the new entrants. The partnership brings together Amazon, the online retail giant known for disrupting major industries; Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company led by billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett; and JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the United States by assets. \\nThey are moving into an industry where the lines between traditionally distinct areas, such as pharmacies, insurers and providers, are increasingly blurry. CVS Health’s deal last month to buy the health insurer Aetna for about $69 billion is just one example of the changes underway. Separately, Amazon’s potential entry into the pharmacy business continues to rattle major drug companies and distributors. \\nThe companies said the initiative, which is in its early stages, would be “free from profit-making incentives and constraints,” but did not specify whether that meant they would create a nonprofit organization. The tax implications were also unclear because so few details were released. \\nJamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said in a statement that the effort could eventually be expanded to benefit all Americans. \\n“The health care system is complex, and we enter into this challenge open-eyed about the degree of difficulty,” Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, said in a statement. “Hard as it might be, reducing health care’s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort.” \\nThe announcement touched off a wave of speculation about what the new company might do, especially given Amazon’s extensive reach into the daily lives of Americans — from where they buy their paper towels to what they watch on television. It follows speculation that the company, which recently purchased the grocery chain Whole Foods, might use its stores as locations for pharmacies or clinics. \\n“It could be big,” Ed Kaplan, who negotiates health coverage on behalf of large employers as the national health practice leader for the Segal Group, said of the announcement. “Those are three big players, and I think if they get into health care insurance or the health care coverage space, they are going to make a big impact.” \\nBut others were less sure, noting that the three companies — which, combined, employ more than 1 million people — might still hold little sway over the largest insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, who oversee the benefits of tens of millions of Americans. \\n“This is not news in terms of jumbo employers being frustrated with what they can get through the traditional system,” said Sam Glick of the management consulting firm Oliver Wyman in San Francisco. He played down the notion that the three partners would have more success getting lower prices from hospitals and doctors. “The idea that they could have any sort of negotiation leverage with unit cost is a pretty far stretch.” \\nEven the three companies do not seem to be sure of how to shake up health care. People briefed on the plan, who asked for anonymity because the discussions were private, said the executives decided to announce the initiative while still a concept in part so they can begin hiring staff for the new company. \\nThree people familiar with the partnership said it took shape as Bezos, Buffett and Dimon, who are friends, discussed the challenges of providing insurance to their employees. They decided their combined access to data about how consumers make choices, along with an understanding of the intricacies of health insurance, would inevitably lead to some kind of new efficiency — whatever it might turn out to be. \\n“The ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,” Buffett said in the statement. “Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable.” \\nOver the past several months, the three had met formally — along with Todd Combs, an investment officer at Berkshire Hathaway who is also on JPMorgan’s board — to discuss the idea, according to a person familiar with Buffett’s thinking. \\nThe three chief executives saw one another at the Alfalfa Club dinner in Washington on Saturday, but by then each had already had dozens of conversations with the small in-house teams they had assembled. The plan was set. \\nBuffett’s motivation stems in part from conversations he has had with two people close to him who have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, according to the person. Buffett, the person said, believes the condition of the country’s health care system is a root cause of economic inequality, with wealthier people enjoying better, longer lives because they can afford good coverage. As Buffett himself has aged — he is 87 — the contrast between his moneyed friends and others has grown starker, the person said. \\nThe companies said they would initially focus on using technology to simplify care, but did not elaborate on how they intended to do that or bring down costs. One of the people briefed on the alliance said the new company would not replace existing health insurers or hospitals. \\nPlanning for the new company is being led by Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold, a JPMorgan managing director who was previously head of the Swiss drugmaker Novartis’ mergers and acquisitions strategy; Combs; and Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon. \\nOne potential avenue for the partnership might be an online health care dashboard that connects employees with the closest and best doctor specializing in whatever ailment they select from a drop-down menu. Perhaps the companies would strike deals to offer employee discounts with service providers like medical testing facilities. \\n“Each of those companies has extensive experience using transformative technology in their own businesses,” said John Sculley, the former chief executive of Apple who is now chairman of a health care startup, RxAdvance. “I think it’s a great counterweight to what government leadership hasn’t done, which is to focus on how do we make this health care system sustainable.” \\nErik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, predicted that the companies would attempt to modernize the cumbersome process of doctor appointments by making it more like booking a restaurant reservation on OpenTable, while eliminating the need to regularly fill out paper forms on clipboards. \\n“I think they will bring the customer-facing, patient-facing thing into your smartphone,” he said. \\nAmazon has long been mentioned by health care analysts and industry executives as a potential new player in the sector. While the company has remained quiet about its plans, some analysts noted that companies often use their own employees as a testing ground for future initiatives. \\nThe entry of Amazon and its partners adds to the upheaval in an industry where much is changing, from government programs after the overhaul of the tax law to the uncertain future of the Affordable Care Act. All the while, medical costs have persistently been on the rise. \\nNationwide, average premiums for family coverage for employees rose to $18,764 last year, an increase of 19 percent since 2012, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Workers are increasingly paying a greater share of those costs — they now pay 30 percent of the premium, in addition to high deductibles and growing copayments. \\n“Our members’ balance sheets speak for themselves — health care is a growing cost at a time when other costs are either not rising or falling,” said Robert Andrews, chief executive of the Healthcare Transformation Alliance, a group of 46 companies, including Coca-Cola and American Express, that have banded together to lower health care costs. \\nOther major employers have also sought more direct control over their employees’ health care. Walmart contracted with groups like the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo and Geisinger, among others, to take care of employees who need organ transplants and heart and spine care. Caterpillar, the construction equipment manufacturer, sets its own rules for drug coverage, which it has said saves it millions of dollars per year, even though it still uses a pharmacy benefit manager to process its claims. \\nSuzanne Delbanco, the executive director for the Catalyst for Payment Reform, a nonprofit group that mainly represents employers, said controlling rising prices is especially hard in markets where a local hospital or medical group dominates. While some have tried to tackle the issue in different ways, like sending employees with heart conditions to a specific group, “it’s piecemeal,” she said. \\nShe added, “There are so many opportunities to do this better.” \\nThe issue is not solely a 21st-century concern: In 1915, Henry Ford became increasingly worried about the quality of health care available to his growing workforce in Detroit, so he opened the Henry Ford Hospital. It is still in existence today.

Workers are increasingly paying a greater share of those costs — they now pay 30 percent of the premium, in addition to high deductibles and growing copayments.\\n“Our members’ balance sheets speak for themselves — health care is a growing cost at a time when other costs are either not rising or falling,” said Robert Andrews, chief executive of the Healthcare Transformation Alliance, a group of 46 companies, including Coca-Cola and American Express, that have banded together to lower health care costs.\\nOther major employers have also sought more direct control over their employees’ health care. Walmart contracted with groups like the Cleveland Clinic, Mayo and Geisinger, among others, to take care of employees who need organ transplants and heart and spine care. Caterpillar, the construction equipment manufacturer, sets its own rules for drug coverage, which it has said saves it millions of dollars per year, even though it still uses a pharmacy benefit manager to process its claims.\\nSuzanne Delbanco, the executive director for the Catalyst for Payment Reform, a nonprofit group that mainly represents employers, said controlling rising prices is especially hard in markets where a local hospital or medical group dominates. While some have tried to tackle the issue in different ways, like sending employees with heart conditions to a specific group, “it’s piecemeal,” she said.\\nShe added, “There are so many opportunities to do this better.”\\nThe issue is not solely a 21st-century concern: In 1915, Henry Ford became increasingly worried about the quality of health care available to his growing workforce in Detroit, so he opened the Henry Ford Hospital. It is still in existence today.\\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times . NICK WINGFIELD, KATIE THOMAS and REED ABELSON © 2018 The New York Times  Caterpillar Inc.

Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) , the world\\'s largest construction and mining-equipment manufacturer, that was struggling to keep its foot firm amid the hugely challenging business conditions, saw its stock soar a jaw-dropping 70% in 2017. Caterpillar was among the most powerful Dow comeback stories in 2017 . \\nCaterpillar\\'s recovery was long due, but the dramatic run-up in the stock has stoked bulls and bears alike. So on one hand, Caterpillar shares have been retreating ever since the company released its fourth-quarter numbers and guidance for 2018 last week, hinting that the stock may have run its course. On the other hand, some analysts firms have turned increasingly bullish about Caterpillar in recent weeks. \\nWith Wall Street clearly divided over Caterpillar, here\\'s what you, as an investor, should expect from the company and its shares in 2018. Why 2017 was a significant year for Caterpillar \\nWhile several factors fueled Caterpillar\\'s rally in 2017, management\\'s conservative guidance hugely helped the company exceed expectations quarter after quarter, fueling investor optimism. Last week was no different, when Caterpillar reported its fourth-quarter and full-year numbers, beating its own estimates yet again. Has Caterpillar stock become risky, or is there still some steam left? Image source: Getty Images. The following table should give you an idea how dramatically management\\'s outlook for 2017 improved as the year progressed. Metric Projected FY 2017 (As of Q3) Projected FY 2017 (As of Q2) Projected FY 2017 (As of Q1) Revenue $3.75 Data source: Caterpillar Inc. financials. \\nDon\\'t let that sharp drop in Caterpillar\\'s actual EPS for fiscal 2017 detract you. Caterpillar booked a $2.37 billion tax provision during the fourth quarter related to the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings under the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation. Otherwise, the company turned an operating profit of $4.4 billion in 2017, versus only $498 million in fiscal 2016. \\nDon\\'t get me wrong. I\\'m not trying to say management\\'s conservative forecasts alone boosted Caterpillar\\'s shares. But management wouldn\\'t be bullish if not for improving business conditions, and the recovery has been faster and stronger than anyone expected. How are Caterpillar\\'s key end markets doing? \\nCaterpillar is seeing a broad-based recovery in sales, with sales volumes improving in each of its business segments -- construction industries, resource industries (primarily mining equipment), and energy and transportation. Among these, construction industries sprung up the biggest surprises last year, as demand for equipment from the Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, surged. An uptick in residential and non-residential construction in North America is providing further support. Image source: Getty Images. \\nThe biggest turnaround, though, can be seen in Caterpillar\\'s resource industries division -- which clocked a 53% jump in year-over-year sales during the fourth quarter -- thanks to recovering commodity prices that are breathing life into the beleaguered mining sector. In a recent interview with Mining Global, Agustín Costa, partner and managing director at The Boston Consulting Group, pegged spending by major miners to hit $41 billion in 2017, up 7% year over year. And let\\'s not forget the oil price recovery in the latter half of 2017, which gave Caterpillar bulls yet another reason to propel the stock. Take a look at how Caterpillar shares mirrored the rise in oil prices after July 2017: CAT data by YCharts. Why 2018 could be one of Caterpillar\\'s best years \\nThe ongoing recovery across all its key end markets should propel Caterpillar\\'s sales and earnings higher. This is what Caterpillar expects from each market: Construction industries: Improving North American residential, non-residential, and infrastructure markets. Strong sales from China. Resource industries: Greater capital spending as miners \"invest in equipment replacement cycles.\" Higher machine utilization should drive aftermarket demand. Energy and transportation: Strong demand for reciprocating engines and turbines from the oil and gas sector. Challenging locomotive and marine markets, but a potential recovery in power generation. \\nOverall, Caterpillar projects higher sales volumes to be the biggest growth driver of profits in 2018, which is a surefire sign of better days ahead for the company. \\nThe best part, however, is Caterpillar\\'s profit guidance for fiscal 2018: It expects to earn a profit of $7.75 to $8.75 per share. The company last hit those earnings level around 2012-2013, when business was at its peak. CAT Free Cash Flow Per Share (Annual) data by YCharts \\nThere\\'s another incredible takeaway from that chart: Caterpillar\\'s cash flows are on solid footing, with the company consistently converting 100% or more of its net income into free cash flow. In fact, Caterpillar even increased its dividend last year, marking the 24th consecutive year of dividend increases. That also means the company is just one dividend increase away from joining the elite Dividend Aristocrat group. The Foolish bottom line \\nCaterpillar\\'s solid outlook does not include any impact of a potential uptick in infrastructure spending in the U.S. if President Trump were to pass his $1 trillion spending bill in the near future. Given Caterpillar\\'s foothold in the industry and unparalleled brand power, it\\'ll probably be one of the biggest beneficiaries when infrastructure spending kicks off. \\nKeeping that in mind, I can say Caterpillar\\'s operational turnaround may have just started. And while there will be instances of profit booking given the stock\\'s incredible rally, Caterpillar remains one of the best cyclical stocks you could own for the long haul. \\n10 stocks we like better than Caterpillar \\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The new plan called for an estimated workforce of 175 people at the new headquarters by the end of 2017, with an office population of about 300 once fully operational at the end of 2018. \\nThen, as now, the company stressed that a vast majority of its 12,000 Peoria-area employees would remain local. And even as the headquarters transition moved ahead in 2017, Caterpillar continued to host customers from 36 countries and 39 states in Peoria, according to figures released by the company. \\nMore than 2,000 Caterpillar employees also continue to work Downtown in the administration buildings, which are being renovated from individual work station upgrades to infrastructure repairs on the roof. That work will continue into 2019. \\n\"Our employees’ workstations and other amenities will all be remodeled, as we have done in many of our global office buildings,\" said Henry Vicary, Caterpillar\\'s guest and community relations director. \"We believe these updates will enhance the work experience for thousands of our employees who work in downtown Peoria.\" \\nBeyond the immediate emotional reaction to the headquarters announcement last year that Mayor Jim Ardis described as a punch to the gut, the development created long-term practical concerns for area officials and residents. \\nAn entire city block had been emptied Downtown in preparation for Caterpillar\\'s former headquarters plans. Those workers weren\\'t coming back, and any private Downtown development ideas tied to Cat\\'s plans also were dashed. \\nAnd though not all Caterpillar employees tapped to work at the new headquarters would move from the Peoria area, a glut of homes entering the market all at once threatened to destabilize the residential real estate market in the region. \\nTo that end, Caterpillar introduced a real estate incentive program in phases over the course of the summer. All homes in the company\\'s relocation program — not just the houses of employees headed to the new headquarters — would be eligible for a reimbursement of certain costs of up to 3 percent of the final sale price. Additional incentives applied to select homes on the upper end of the market. \\nBy the end of the year, 132 homes in Caterpillar\\'s program sold, contributing to a slight overall increase in home sales for the year over 2016, according to the Peoria Area Association of Realtors (PAAR). Ninety homes eligible for the incentive remained on the market in January, with the program scheduled to continue through 2018. \\nProspective buyers expressed uncertainty at the time of the Caterpillar headquarters announcement, but the market with the company incentives demonstrated stability by the end of the year, said PAAR CEO Dallas Hancock. \\n\"The goal of the incentive program was sustainability, and the market here saw that in 2017,\" Hancock said, noting that some buyers came to the market because of the incentives but ended up buying other homes. \"After all that uncertainty, we\\'re seeing consumer confidence coming back up.\" \\nA couple of weeks before the one-year anniversary of Caterpillar\\'s headquarters announcement, the vacant adjacent block became the subject of major news, too. \\nThe company donated the entire block and millions of dollars that had been earmarked for demolition of the property to OSF HealthCare to redevelop the former Chase Bank building into a new ministry headquarters and create Downtown amenities for employees of both groups. \\nBusiness owners, developers, elected officials and representatives of laborers in the trades all lauded the development, eager to see life return to the vacant block and — once again — possibly spark new plans for the fading storefronts in the vicinity. \\n\"OSF HealthCare is excited to be returning to the roots of our sisters in Downtown Peoria when we move the headquarters for our Ministry into the former Chase building,\" said CEO Bob Sehring. \"This opportunity was made possible through collaboration with Caterpillar and the city of Peoria.\" \\nSehring added: \"It is our hope that this project sparks even more development as we contribute to a revitalized and robust Downtown Peoria, one that will attract and retain energetic leadership for years to come.\" \\nMatt Buedel can be reached at 686-3154 or mbuedel@pjstar.com.
